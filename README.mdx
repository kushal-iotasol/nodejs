This document is curarted to introduce you to the world of Node.js. Make you comfortable with high level key concepts and also get you familiarize with different aspects of Node.js. Once you understand these basic concepts, it will give you enough confidence to learn the more complex concepts easily and on a rapid pace. This assignment is structured in such a manner that you should do it step by step without skipping any question and without taking any help from your peers or from the internet.

<center>Welcome to exciting world of Nodejs</center>

## _Best Practices_

- Use proper naming convention for variables. Use variable name which make sense as per the logic you are builing.

- Use comments at all required places.

- Save all assignments in different files and keep the proper name of the files.

- Organise the assignments in folders.

- Try to use the minimum number of lines to produce the desired output.

- Find and try to make your programs more efficient and use minimum number of variables and constructs.

- Try to reduce the complexity of the programs by reducing usage of loops and conditions.

- Try to write modular code and create function of reusable code.

- Don’t take help of internet for finding the solution online. You can take help of internet to learn and understand the concepts but again not for find the solutions.

- Don’t copy the code snippets from your peers. You can take help of them for understanding the concepts but again not for copying it.

- Don’t just rely on the questions in these assignment, the more you practice the more you learn. So don’t limit yourselves to these questions, try to find more similar problems online and solve them.
